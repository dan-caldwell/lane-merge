# Zipper Merge

This is a library for turning one stylesheet into HTML and CSS. Merge your CSS and HTML into one file for a simpler markup writing experience.

## Getting started

1. Create an index.scss file in /src
2. Add your SCSS. For the SCSS to be transformed, you must have a top level "html" selector with all your markup inside
3. Run ```npm run dev``` to run the Express server and watch for changes
4. Go to localhost:8000 to view your markup
